# The Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Built a Tic-Tac-Toe game without the implementation of artificial intelligence, using random to implement a CPU's move which emulates a gameplay with the player. 

Here is how the game program works: 

- the computer plays the game using 'X's; the user play the game using 'O's.

- the first move belongs to the computer (it always puts its first 'X' in the middle of the board).

- all the squares are numbered row by row starting with 1.

- the program checks if the game is over (there are four possible verdicts: the game should continue, the game ends with a tie, you win, or the computer wins).

- the computer responds with its move and the check is repeated.
